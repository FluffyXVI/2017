# 2017
Assorted projects completed in 2017. Further information about these projects, including some sample outputs, can be found at the Github page [here.](https://fluffyxvi.github.io/2017/)

## Modules
Many of my projects would not be possible without some fantastic community-created modules.
### Pillow
```
  pip install pillow
```
Used in Pixelception and Mandelbrot in order to create and save images.
### ThreeJS
```
  https://threejs.org/
```
Used in my 3D browser projects, including my Solar System.

### Pixelception
A series of scripts involving generating images out of a collage of other images.

### Mandelbrot
Originally created for a Maths C assignment in 2016, then updated in January by request of a friend. These scripts focus on analysing variations of the Mandelbrot set and Julia sets, and explore some of the correlations between them.

### Solar System
A remake of a project originally completed in 2015. A simplified simulation of a solar system, including stars, planets, and moons. Updated further to create some exciting 3D effects.

### Polygon
A simple script to generate a pattern out of triangles.
